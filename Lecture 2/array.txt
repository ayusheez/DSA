1D array Questions:
🟢 LEVEL 1: Absolute Basics (must know cold)
Declare and initialize an array
Find length of an array
Access elements using index
Traverse array using:
for loop
enhanced for loop
Take array input from user
Print array elements
If any of these take thinking time, you’re not “perfect” yet.
🟡 LEVEL 2: Core Logic Questions (non-negotiable)
Find maximum element
Find minimum element
Sum of all elements
Average of elements
Count even and odd numbers
Count positive, negative, zero
Reverse an array
Copy one array into another
Swap first and last element
Swap alternate elements
These build raw confidence.
🟠 LEVEL 3: Searching & Position Logic
Linear search
Binary search (array must be sorted)
Find index of an element
Find all occurrences of an element
Count frequency of each element
Arrays start behaving like puzzles here.
🔵 LEVEL 4: Sorting (logic builder)
Sort array in ascending order (manual)
Sort array in descending order
Bubble sort
Selection sort
Insertion sort
If you understand why these work, your brain just upgraded.
🟣 LEVEL 5: Duplicate & Unique Elements
Find duplicate elements
Remove duplicate elements
Print unique elements
Count duplicate elements
Find first repeating element
Welcome to interview land.
🔴 LEVEL 6: Rotation & Rearrangement
Rotate array left
Rotate array right
Shift all zeros to end
Move all negative numbers to one side
Separate even and odd numbers
Logic + patience test.
🟤 LEVEL 7: Subarrays & Advanced Thinking
Largest element in subarray
Smallest element in subarray
Maximum subarray sum
Find subarray with given sum
Longest increasing subarray
This is where “perfect” starts meaning something.
⚫ LEVEL 8: Special Problems (boss level)
Second largest element
Second smallest element
Missing number in array
Array is palindrome or not
Merge two arrays
Intersection of two arrays
Union of two arrays
Check if array is sorted
Find equilibrium index
If you can solve these without Googling, arrays bow to you.
Final truth (read twice)
You don’t master arrays by reading answers.
You master arrays by:
Writing logic on paper
Making mistakes
Debugging like a detective
Rewriting solutions cleaner
Solve these in order.
No skipping levels. No ego.
